                <dt>What is a Yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
                    with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

                <dt>How are yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queensize bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                    camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
                    restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light
                    layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
